# CPU Scheduler - Gantt Chart (React)

This is a small React + Vite project that recreates the CPU scheduler Gantt chart UI (FCFS) from http://cpuburst.com/ganttcharts.html

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will open on the port that Vite chooses (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes

- This is a minimal recreation of the FCFS Gantt chart with editable processes and context switch time.
- Feel free to ask for additions (other scheduling algorithms, improved visuals, export, etc.).
